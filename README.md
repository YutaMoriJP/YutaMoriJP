- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @YutaMoriJP
- I love the Frontend, especially React and CSS. In my private time, I like learning new technologies, and working on personal projects or open source projects like my 2 React libraries, [Kantan-Components](https://kantan-components-docs.netlify.app/) and [Kantan-Hooks](https://kantan-hooks-docs.netlify.app/).
- I'm currently a Frontend dev at Rakuten.
